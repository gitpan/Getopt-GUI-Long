MODULE

  Getopt::GUI::Long - a drop in Getopt::Long replacement supporting an
  optional GUI

SYNOPSIS

  use Getopt::GUI::Long;

  # pass useful config options to Configure
  Getopt::GUI::Long::Configure(qw(display_help no_ignore_case capture_output));
  GetOptions(\%opts,
	     ["h|help", "Show help for command line options"],
	     ["some-flag=s", "perform some flag based on a value"]);

  # or

  GetOptions(["h|help", "Show help for command line options"] => \$help,
	     ["some-flag=s", "perform some flag based on a value"] => \$flag);

DESCRIPTION

  This module is a wrapper around Getopt::Long that extends the value of
  the originial Getopt::Long module to add a simple graphical user
  interface option screen if no arguments are passed to the program.
  Thus, the arguments to actually use are built based on the results of
  the user interface. If arguments were passed to the program, the user
  interface is not shown and the program executes as it normally would
  and acts just as if Getopt::Long::GetOptions had been called instead.

  It's designed to make the creation of graphical shells trivial
  without the programmer having to think about it much.

EXAMPLE SCREEN SHOTS

  http://www.dnssec-tools.org/ has a bunch of screen shot links on the
  front page where the GUI interface from it is entirely created
  through the Getopt::GUI::Long interface.
